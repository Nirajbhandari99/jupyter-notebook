Instructions to Run the Project

Install Required Libraries
Open your visual studio code (or Anaconda Prompt) and run:

pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn openpyxl

pandas → for dataset handling and preprocessing

numpy → for numerical operations

seaborn & matplotlib → for visualizations

scikit-learn → for machine learning models and evaluation

openpyxl → for reading Excel files

Dataset Location
Make sure the dataset file "heart_data.xlsx" is in the same folder as the Python script (heart.py).
If it is located elsewhere, update the path in the code like this:

df = pd.read_excel("path_to/heart_data.xlsx")

What the Script Does

a. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

Loads the dataset

Handles missing values and normalizes features

Prepares data for model training

b. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Count plots for categorical data distribution

Heatmaps for feature correlation

Histograms for feature distribution

c. Model Training & Testing

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Linear Regression

d. Model Evaluation

Accuracy scores

Confusion matrices

Classification reports (precision, recall, F1-score)

ROC curves for performance comparison

How to Run the Code

Step 1: Open VS code 
Step 2: Navigate to the project folder, make sure heart.py and heart_data.xlsx is in same folder
Step 3: Run the script
python heart.py

Expected Output

Console output with model accuracy scores and evaluation metrics

Visualization plots (heatmaps, histograms, ROC curves, etc.)

Clear identification of the best performing model (e.g., Random Forest ~85% accuracy).
